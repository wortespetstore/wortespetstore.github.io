        <h2>What are values?</h2>
        <p><a href="https://ethicsunwrapped.utexas.edu/glossary/values" target="_blank">Value</a> means worth. A value is a socially acceptable concept of what is important and to what degree.</p>
        <p class="intro">Understanding our ‘value’ means understanding what our participation, our role
            is, with other humans, animals, plants…etc. We live in human society, in nature, and we
            want to find out our role in this expanse!
            In order to find out what is valuable to us, we will explore about ourselves, and we will
            explore about the things around us, the things we live with everyday.</p>
        <h2 class="right">What is Value Education? Why do we need it?</h2>
        <p class="right">The subject that helps us understand what is valuable to human happiness is called value education. Value education is important to help everyone in improving the value system that he/she holds and puts it to use.
             Once, one has understood his/ her values in life he/she can examine and control the various choices he/she makes in his/ her life.
             Value education enables us to understand our needs and visualize our goals correctly and also helps to remove our confusions and contradictions and bring harmony at all levels. </p>
        <p class="right">Values form the basis for all our thoughts, behaviours and actions. Once we know what is valuable to us, these values becomes the basis, the anchor for our actions. In a sense, value education deals with
            what is universally valuable to all of us, what is conducive to our individual and collective
            happiness and prosperity in a sustainable way. It enables us to be in harmony within
            ourselves, with other human beings and with rest of nature at large. </p>
        <h2>Need for <span class="ve">value education</span></h2>
        <p class="list1"> Correct identification of our aspirations</p>
        <p>Value education helps in correctly identifying our basic aspirations. s: All human beings have aspirations. You may
            aspire to become a doctor or engineer or a lawyer, or a film star or something else. You
            must have made various plans for your future, be it immediate or long term. The
            planning may include your personal life, your family, your profession, your participation
            in the society and other such domains. <br> But before you invest your energies to actualize
            your plans, it is important that you find out what you basically aspire for. Based on the correct identification of this basic
            aspiration, you can frame your goals and sub-goals appropriately and working for
            these, you may hope to fulfil your basic aspiration.</p>
        <p class="list1">Understanding universal human values to fulfill our aspirations</p>
        <p>Just identifying one’s aspiration is not enough. We need to know how to fulfil our
            aspirations. Complete understanding of human values gives us a definite way to fulfil our aspirations. Basically all of us are aspiring to be happy and whatever appears conducive to our
            happiness becomes valuable to us. Values form the basis for all our thoughts, behaviour
            and actions. <br> Once we have known what is valuable to us, these values become the
            basis, the anchor for our actions. We know what we are doing is right and will lead to
            the fulfilment of our basic aspirations. Values thus become the source for our happiness,
            our success, our fulfilment. Without an appropriate value framework, we will not be
            able to decide whether a chosen action is desirable or undesirable, right or wrong. <br>
            Hence there is a prime need for correct understanding of the value domain. - Value
            Education is the input necessary to fulfil this need. When we live with the correct
            understanding of values, we are happy in continuity, otherwise we feel deprived,
            frustrated and unhappy. ? It is important to explore the
            value domain in sufficient detail through value education. We also need to understand
            the universality of various human values, because only then we can have a definite and
            common program for value education.  </p>
        <p class="list1">Complementarity of values and skills</p> 
        <p>One has to know what is conductive to human happiness. This is what becomes universally valuable to human beings. This is called value domain. This helps us identify and set the right goals and proceed in the right direction.</p>
        <p>Just identifying the values is not enough, to actually realize this one has to know the methods and practices, to develop techniques to make this happen in real life, This is the domain of skills.
        </p>
        <p>Thus values and skills have to go hand in hand. There is an essential complementarity
            between values and skills for the success of any human endeavour. For example, I want
            to lead a healthy life. I understand that health is the basic requirement for a human
            being. I then learn skills to judge what food will keep my body healthy, what physical
            practices will keep the body functioning properly, what would be the possible ways to
            do certain kinds of work with the body. All these fall under the domain of skills. Thus,
            both (values and skills) are important and these are complementary</p>
        <p class="list1">Evaluation of our beliefs</p>
        <p>In absence of a correct understanding of universal human
            values, we are driven by our ‘ad-hoc’ values and beliefs. If we look deep into ourselves,
            we find that each one of us believes in certain things and we base our ‘values’ on these
            beliefs, be they false or true which may or may not be true in reality. <br> For example,
            someone may believe that “A corporate job is the best kind of job”, “IIT is the best
            college to go to”, “Metro cities are the best places to live in” and so on. We can also
            have beliefs such as “I want to become a famous person. Being a world-famous person
            will make me happy”, “Money will make me happy”, “Success is the ultimate thing,
            by hook or by crook”, “If I study longer I will have better grades” etc. All of us live
            with such beliefs. These beliefs come to us from what we read, see, hear, what our
            parents tell us, our friends talk about, what the magazines talk of, what we see on the
            TV etc. i.e. there is a whole body of belief-system that we live with at any given time
            and these together constitute our worldview. <br> These beliefs spread out far and wide
            into all our realms of living. The interesting thing about beliefs is that they usually
            change with time and we can trace examples of these by looking at our life in the past.
            We might have thought at one point of time that getting into a good college is the
            most important thing and now that may have changed to being able to get a good
            job. Once we get into a good job, doing well in that job and earning a lot of money
            may be important. Once we have the money, getting into a good position may become
            important – i.e. what we believe is to be important, may keep changing with time.
            Many times, we may even find ourselves trapped in conflicting beliefs. <br> Another thing about beliefs is that they are usually not the same for everybody. Beliefs
            could be held by a small group or a large group of people but they are not universal.
            For example: getting good grades may be important to you, but being able to earn
            money may be important for your friends. You may think being environmentally -
            friendly is important, your friend may think that it is okay to pollute the environment.
            This is not only true for ourselves, but largely true for most people around us: the
            beliefs keep changing from person to person. Living our lives based only on beliefs can not ensure happiness for us. This is very
            important for us to understand. Do we want to live with such shaky beliefs? Or do we
            want to know things for sure, for ourselves? We can either blindly follow our beliefs
            and assumed values, towards making our choices or we can base our choices upon
            values which are based on understanding of reality and we can ourselves validate them
            as well. </p>

        </ol>
        <dl>
            <dt>Universal</dt>
            <dd>Whatever we study as value education has to be universally applicable to all human beings
                and be true at all times and all places irrespective of anyone's caste, creed, religion, gender, or nationality.</dd>
            <dt>Rational</dt>
            <dd>It shouldn't be based on dogmas or blind beliefs. It cannot be
                a set of sermons or Do’s and Don’ts.</dd>
            <dt>Natural and verifiable</dt>
            <dd>It should be natural to us. Being natural means, it is acceptable as natural to all human beings. When we live on the basis of such values that are
                natural to us, it leads to fulfilment, leads to our happiness. We also would like to verify these values
                ourselves, i.e. we don’t want to assume something just because it is being stated here or
                written in a book, rather, each one of us will want to verify these to find out whether they
                are true for us. This has to be done by both checking for validity within ourselves, as being
                naturally acceptable as well as something which we can implement in our living and observe
                its outcome to be fulfilling. </dd>
            <dt>All encompassing</dt>
            <dd>Value education is aimed at transforming our consciousness and our way of living. Hence, it has to permeate into all dimensions of our living, namely,
                thought, behaviour, work and understanding. as well as all levels, namely,
                individual, family, society and nature.</dd>
            <dt>Leading to harmony</dt>
            <dd>Finally, value education has to enable us to be in harmony within and in harmony with
                others. </dd>

        <h2>The Content of Value Education</h2>
        <p>The bigger order. - what is the participation of a human being in the bigger order?
            That bigger order includes human beings, plants, air, water, soil, animals, birds etc. The
            value of a human being is the participation of human being in this order. Hence, to understand
            human values, we need to study the human reality along with all that is there in the
            existence constituting the larger order, and the role of human being in the relationship
            with each and every unit in the existence. </p>
        <h4>Any course on Value Education must include</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>All dimensions- thought,behaviour, work, understanding.</li>
            <li>All levels- self, family, society, nature.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Process of Value Education</h2>
        <ul id="process">
            <li>We will verify these proposals through self-exploration. We shall investigate into these
                proposals and try to verify within us in our own right</li>
            <li>This self-exploration will be done on the basis of whether the proposals are acceptable
                to us in a natural manner – i.e. they need to be naturally acceptable to us and not just
                imposed externally. </li>
            <li>Self-exploration will also include verifying the proposals through experiential validation,
                i.e. by living according to them. </li>
            <li>Since the process is of self-exploration, and not of giving sermons or prescribing do’s
                and don’ts, you need not agree to all that is said, but only be ready to investigate into
                them sincerely</li>
            <li>This process is expected to initiate a transformation in our understanding in our
                consciousness and our living</li>
