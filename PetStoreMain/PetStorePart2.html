            <h2>Cats</h2>
            <p class="letter">Having a cat can mean different things to different people. Some want a cat to cuddle and sit on their laps; others are happy to live with a very independent cat that spends most of its time outside and doesn’t want too much human interaction.
                You must try to find a cat that will interact with you if you want it to. All cats are not the same. How each individual cat behaves with you can depend on its inherent personality and early experiences (or lack of affairs), making it fearful or confident with people and life in general.
                The environment in which you keep a cat is also highly significant – for example, if it lives with many other cats that do not get on, it will be stressed and react differently than if it was on its own.</p>
            <h3>Here's how you care for your cat</h3>
            <ul id="catcare1">
                <li>Provide plenty of human companionship</li>
                <li>Provide a clean and comfortable bed</li>
                <li>Groom it regularly. Longhaired cats require daily grooming.</li>
                 <li>Have it neutered between 4 and 6 months old</li>
                 <li>Get your cat dewormed at regular intervals</li>
                <li>Follow a proper vaccination schedule</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Dogs</h2>
            <dl>
                <dt>Training</dt>
                <dd>Compassion, clarity, and consistency are the most important factors of dog training. Training should not include any activity or device that endangers animals (e.g., electric shock collars) or puts unnecessary stress on them. 
                    Good books on the subject include <cite>Click Here for a Well-Trained Dog</cite> by Deborah A. Jones, Ph.D.;<cite>The Power of Positive Dog Training</cite> by Pat Miller; and, for solving dog behavioral problems, <cite>If Only They Could Speak</cite>, <cite>Dogs Behaving Badly</cite>, <cite>and The Dog Who Loved Too Much</cite>, all by Nicholas Dodman. </dd>
                <dt>Walking</dt>
                <dd>Puppies should be taken out at least once every two hours (or within a half-hour after eating or drinking) and guided to the same spot where they can smell, having relieved themselves before. Immediately after they “do their business,” they should be praised grandly in a high-pitched, enthusiastic voice. Crate training does not hasten the housebreaking process: Puppies do not develop complete bladder control before 6 months of age and are physically incapable of “holding it” for very long.</dd>
                <dt>Social interaction</dt>
                <dd>Animals get depressed if robbed of satisfactory social interaction, so let them “chat” and play with other dogs on walks and parks. A happy dog’s life is not one long string of commands: Let them live a little, make choices, and take their time. Animals are susceptible and can become easily frightened, so speak softly to dogs. Don’t fight or shout in their presence, and give them their own hiding places to dart into when they want to be alone.</dd>

            <h2>Rabbits</h2>
            <p class="letter">Rabbits are excellent indoor pets. They're lovely, and full of personality. But before you rush into the shelter and pick out a cute rabbit, there are a few things you need know to be sure a rabbit is the appropriate fit for you and your family.</p>
            <dl>
                <dt>Finances</dt>
                <dd>Finances: Having a rabbit as a pet entails additional financial responsibilities. Prepare to spend money on the adoption fee as well as housing, food, and bunny proofing materials up first. Also, be sure you can afford the continuing expenditures of owning a rabbit, such as food, litter, and medical bills including spay/neuter payments if the bunny didn't receive the procedure while at the shelter/rescue.</dd>
                <dt>Housing</dt>
                <dd>Rabbits are sociable creatures. The location of a rabbit's living space within your house is critical. You'll need to make sure the rabbit has a private space where he can relax but isn't entirely cut off from the rest of the family. Rabbits require a lot of social interaction, exercise, and enrichment activities.</dd>
                <dt>Bunny proofing your house</dt>
                <dd>If the rabbit will have unrestricted access to the house/apartment/room, you must bunny proof the space. Even if you keep the rabbit in a cage, condo, or puppy pen, you'll need to keep your house secure while letting it out for supervised exercise. Rabbits are inquisitive and persistent animals. They'll find a way into your computer cords, wiring, moulding, sofa piping, torn carpets, and so on. They're going to consume all of your crucial paperwork.</dd>
                <dt>Nutrition</dt>
                <dd>It's crucial to understand a rabbit's dietary requirements throughout his or her life. A rabbit's well-being depends on proper nourishment (in the right proportions). Fiber is a rabbit's main source of nutrition. At all times, rabbits must have full access to grass hay. It's critical to make certain that no one in the family suffers from hay fever.</dd>

            <h2>Turtles</h2>
            <p class="letter">Taking care of a pet turtle isn't as simple as it appears. The decision to keep a turtle as a pet should be carefully considered. Turtles take particular attention and cleaning, and they don't get along well with children—turtles may bite and dislike being handled—but they're still fascinating pets to watch.</p>
            <dl>
                <dt>Setting up a tank</dt>
                <dd>To allow for growing to mature size, a turtle's indoor environment should be at least 40 gallons. A heat light for bathing should also be included. The tank must have a land or dry area as well as a swimming or wet area. Make sure you learn everything you can about the turtle you want to acquire so you can give the best possible living conditions.</dd>
                <dt>Temperatures</dt>
                <dd>Turtles are cold-blooded creatures that require a consistent temperature to thrive. Turtles like a temperature of 60 to 90 degrees Fahrenheit to dwell in. Some turtles may survive in temperatures as low as 50 degrees at night, but anything lower than that can cause them to hibernate or get ill. For aquatic turtles, it is recommended to heat the water and incorporate a basking light to warm the air in the tank.</dd>
                <dt>Food and Diet</dt>
                <dd>Turtles eat a variety of meals to maintain a healthy diet, which commonly includes fresh and flaked food, live bugs, and vitamin A to aid their growth. Turtle food is available from Wortes Pet Store, as well as fish food and pet retailers.</dd>

            <h2>Snakes<span class="ast">&ast;</span></h2>
            <p class="letter">Snakes are fantastic pets, but keep in mind that they live for decades on average, so you'll be making a long-term commitment to your chosen snake. Make sure you get a snake that has been bred in captivity and is free of infections and other issues that snakes grown in the wild may have.</p>
            <dl>
                <dt>Habitat</dt>
                <dd>The most vital elements to have for your new pet snake are an enclosure and somewhere for it to hide inside its new home. Once you've decided on a snake breed, choose a home that is appropriate for that species. Snakes that dwell on trees, for example, will want a towering, vertical house, whilst those that reside on the ground will prefer larger enclosures.</dd>
                <dt>Temperatures and Humidity</dt>
                <dd>Be careful to look up the light requirements for your specific snake breed. A basking lamp, which may be suspended from a branch, is used by all snakes. Some snakes require natural sunshine, while others benefit from UV light. It's critical to keep the temperature and humidity of your new snake's environment under control. Thermometers and hygrometers are available at pet stores to assist you keep track of temperature and humidity.</dd>
                <dt>Food and Diet</dt>
                <dd>You'll want to make sure you're happy to deliver the greatest diet possible once you've created the right cage. All snakes consume whole flesh, and many species love live mice, rats, other reptiles, and insects every two to four months. In the winter, they tend to eat less regularly. Frozen mice and rats, which may be purchased and kept, are also eaten by many pet snakes.</dd>
