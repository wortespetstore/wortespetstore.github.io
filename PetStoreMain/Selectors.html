            <h1>Cats</h1>

            <h2 id="siam"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siamese#:~:text=Siamese%20describes%20something%20of%20or,Thailand%2C%20usually%20including%20Southern%20Thailand." target="_blank">Siamese</a></h2>
            <p>Popular since the 19th century, this cat breed originated in <b>Thailand</b>(formerly known as Siam).1 The Siamese has been a foundational breed for the Oriental shorthair, sphynx, and Himalayan. Most Siamese cats have distinct markings called <em> "points" </em> that are the areas of coloration on their face, ears, feet, and tail. </p>
            <h2 id="per"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_cat" target="_blank">Persian</a></h2>
            <p id="iran">Also lovingly referred to as one of the "smushed-face" cats, the <i>Iranian</i> cat or <em>Shiraz</em> cat (named for a city in Iran), Persians have beautiful, long fur coats. They can come in almost any color and have a flat face when compared to most other breeds of cats. Persians are featured in many movies, artworks, and commercials and have been one of the most popular breeds of cats for decades. Their coats demand regular grooming, otherwise, matting will result. Like many purebreds, they are prone to a variety of diseases, including renal and cardiac problems.</p>
            <h2 id="coon"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maine_Coon" target="_blank">Maine coon</a></h2>
            <p id="poly"> Known for its large stature and thick fur coat, the Maine coon is a cat that is difficult to ignore. Hailing from the state of Maine and the state’s official cat, the Maine coon is a gentle giant. They are great hunters and were popularized after the CFA recognized them as purebred in the late 1970s. They remain one of the most popular cat breeds. Many Maine coons have <em>polydactylism</em>, or extra toes, which makes their already large feet even larger.</p>
            <h2 id="rag"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ragdoll" target="_blank">Ragdoll</a></h2>
            <p>Ragdolls get their name from their docile temperament. They tend to go limp when picked up, much like a rag doll. At one time, people thought they couldn’t feel pain, but that is not true.</p>
            <h2 id="bengal">Bengal</h2>
            <p>Bengals are wild-looking cats—literally. Their markings make them look more like they belong in the jungle rather than in your home, but they are domesticated. They are talkative and require a lot of exercise. They come in many colors with patterns like spots and rosettes.</p>
            <h2>Cat Breeds</h2>
            <h3 class="domestic">Domestic</h3>
            <p>Domestic cats make great pets due to their manageable size and relatively low maintenance.</p>
            <h3 class="purebred">Purebred</h3>
            <p>Purebreds, also called purebreeds, are "cultivated varieties" of an animal species achieved through the process of selective breeding. When the lineage of a purebred animal is recorded, that animal is said to be pedigreed.</p>
            <h3 class="hybrid">Hybrid</h3>
            <p>Hybrid cat breeds are created when a domestic cat is bred with an undomesticated or wild cat breed. This breeding may be done in an attempt to get more wild patterns, colors, and other physical features or to combine favorite personality traits and other attributes of domestic and wild cats</p>
